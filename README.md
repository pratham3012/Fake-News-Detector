# Fake-News-Detector

This advanced python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. Using sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Then, we initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares.
I leveraged some test data and code that will train the model with our data using a passive aggressive classifier (PAC) that will determine whether a piece of text is true or false. The main concept behind a PAC is that it is less memory intensive and uses each training sample to re-evaluate the weights for the training algorithm. Get the prediction right, keep it to the same, get it wrong, tweak the algorithm. It is a popular machine learning algorithm especially when doing work such as fake news detection.
